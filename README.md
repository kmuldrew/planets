# planets
Simple web page showing earth centered view of the planets

The javascript codes includes a simple database of geocentric positions for the visible planets and shows them on a 24h clock face. The sun gives local apparent time and the shading represents daylight and night for the particular day for an observer at 51' North. No optimization is done on the size of the database whatsoever; ten years of data fits easily into the browser memory of even the meanest device so though it may pain older programmers, the values for Saturn barely change but are in the database anyway.
